I managed to sprint to the next cab in an instance.

The meeting room was huge. And full of people who were staring at me. Somebody must have told them that I'm the director's son. Great!
Suddenly a strict looking woman entered the room and the mumbling stopped instantly.
Woman: Silence, you are here to become the best of the best hotel professionals in the world and those professionals don't chatter!
Okay, the next month will be hell.
Woman: My name is Florence and everytime you have questions you come to me. I'm responsible for your training.

In the next two hours Florence told us how a hotel works, who the guests are and what we will be doing to keep everything clean and the guests happy.
When she finished my head was aching.
Florence: For your first day, I want you to explore the hotel WITHOUT making noice or being visible to our guests. Do you hear me? When I ask you tomorrow where the kitchen is, you can tell me. When I ask you how many rooms we have, you can answer me. Got it? Dismissed!
Mike: Afraid? You souldn't, Florence is nice once you got to know her better.
Mike again appeard out of nowhere.
Me: Okay, so where should I begin?
Mike: I guess the lobby would be a good orientation point. Go there! Okay man, I have to get back to work. Whenever you need something or if you need some insider knowledge about the hotel, visit me at the elevator.
