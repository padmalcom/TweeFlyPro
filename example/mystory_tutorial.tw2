It was raining when I arrived at the station on Friday. Since I hadn't brought too much luggage
I managed to sprint to the next cab in an instance.

<span style="color:blue">Me</span>: To the Atlantic hotel please.
<span style="color:green">Driver</span>: You do not look like most of the guys I bring there.
<span style="color:blue">Me</span>: I'm not a guest, I'm working there.
<span style="color:green">Driver</span>: And then you can afford a cab? Must be a well payed job.
<span style="color:blue">Me</span>: I... my father is the director. I'm beginning my training there this week.
<span style="color:green">Driver</span>: I can't believe it! I know the sun of the manager of the Atlantic! What's your name boy?
<span style="color:blue">Me</span>: My name is...

<span style="color:green">Driver</span>: Hello <<print $player_name>>, it is an honor to meet you. Have a good start in this wonderful city full of crime and intrigues.
<span style="color:blue">Me</span>: Yeah, thanks.

The cab stopped at a lively street. The hotel was enourmous. Since I grew up with my mom I only knew the complex from photos.
